<p>From my Whatsapp status saying ‘Missing DA’ to the ones made from my Facebook post of ‘Missing DA’, one could easily infer that I was genuinely and sincerely ‘Missing DA’ all throughout this biting cold December.</p>

<p>The immortalized memories of my time here full of nostalgia was what prompted me to write my first article for Entelechy, devoted to the wonderful time spent here in DA-IICT.</p>

<p>After the end of examinations in college, as I was preparing to go back home, and while I was packing my bags and putting everything in order; I thought of my ‘Home Sweet Home’, and I felt extremely excited by the thought of going back to my own house. Meeting my mother and father after quite a long time, eating delicious home-cooked food and meeting all of my old best friends from school – all of that lured me into that illusionary delight at the thought of getting to go back home finally. But that didn’t last very long.
After a few days, the changes in my perception of being away from college and feeling satiated at home were quite drastic. I was extremely happy to meet my mom and dad after such a long time, but as the days passed, I felt like something inside me was missing.</p>

<p>I began to miss all of my dearest friends in DA-IICT, their idiotic jokes followed by the obvious consequent laughter, the Harlem Shake that we danced away to – which was quite a thrilling and bold experience, done on the day just before the infamous “Calculus Deal”, watching movies on some random senior’s laptop and lots of those fun-filled, completely chaotic things that we did. The food at home was wonderful, but it wasn’t the way Chotu bhai made it, in his obviated ‘Chotu Bhai’ style nor did I have any of my friends gathering around me in canteen as I shared my lunches and dinners and other meals with them, like a daily ritual that was subconsciously imbibed in me. As December mockingly dragged on, I grew extremely sick of my vacations and started missing all the cutthroat competition that happened in college right around the exam time. I began to realize that more than the pressure of exams, it was the group studies that took place then that I enjoyed the most.</p>

<p><img align="middle" src="/images/daiict.jpg" height="500px" width="800px" />
<br /></p>

<p>In the meantime, one of my closest friend’s birthday was coming. From our conversations, I could make out that inspite of the fact that his Mom and Dad were there to celebrate his birthday and would ensure a wonderful celebration of the occasion; his birthday was still missing the spark of those ruthless hostel friends and the way they “celebrate” your birthday, branded slippers, selfie snaps, late night CR’s and of course our own exotic reinterpretation of the traditional “birthday party”. His 12 am counter-survivals to the birthday bashes were in-felicitously replaced by numerous midnight stroke-of-the-hour birthday calls.</p>

<p>And surely, how could I forget the most important events of first semester: Was it Concours? Or IFEST?
The answer to these questions is neither. The most important “events” as such for us in the first semester, were indeed the ‘HM Meeting’ events that were held throughout the semester. The randomness of twenty different people in one group gathering up time and again in the CEP, lab or cafe; the rampant fear of our survival on the day of the presentation in front of ‘Pandya Sir’ and the incessant reading of humanities literature leaving those supposedly tagged important courses behind; all of that complicated quite a huge chunk of our simple-headed lives. My initial discontentment about the course was undoubtedly removed as we progressed through it and reached the end and it will always remain the most extraordinarily interesting subject for me in my engineering studies.</p>

<p>The best lesson that I learnt here is that the world doesn’t revolve around our CPI’s. College is all about the opportunities that you get and the experiences you gain, not the markings on your final transcript. Although the battle for pointers is ineludible, we do have quite a classic battle-field to rejoice about!</p>

<p>I find myself the most fortunate as I am not among those fourth yearites who are trying to prepare themselves to slowly and subtly drift away from their humorous friends, affectionate lovers, hopped-up clubs, hostel life and most importantly losing all of that which constitutes their daily part of COLLEGE LIFE. The dreariness is spreading over the whole campus in view of their departure. As far as the students of the first year are concerned, I am glad that the journey is just a beginning, and we are geared up to drive ourselves farther ahead in the incredible expedition towards success.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the most astonishing amongst all of the happenings of the previous year was getting admission in DA-IICT and enjoying living in the inferiority complex of it. I tried my best to intricate my feelings for DA-IICT but words will surely fail to elaborate my emotions, affection and sentiments associated with it.</p>
